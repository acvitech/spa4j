SPA4J
===========

Spa for Java (SPA4J) is a library created to support and run Single Page application (like Angular application) in different Java based wrappers. As of now, the library provides supporting classes to wrap an angular application in a 
1. JavaFX based desktop application 
2. Web Archive and supports progressive web app using AppCache

I will attempt to support other SPA app type (like React), if not supported automatically.
